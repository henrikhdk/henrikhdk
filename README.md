# 👋 Hey there!

⚙️ Building tools, games, and experiments with `Unreal Engine`, `Next.js`, `Python`, and `C++`  
🧠 Currently chasing AI, game dev, and creative automation — one side project at a time  

## 📚 Always Learning

- 📖 Audiobooks while training for the NYC Marathon (yes, I code *and* run)

## 🧪 Projects & Experiments
